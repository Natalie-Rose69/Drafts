Anxiety

I wouldn’t be surprised if I stutter during this line,
my heart is racing and I'm losing time.
Why are the hands of the clock stuck in place?
the two voices in my head are having debates.

My heart is racing and I'm losing time
is the temperature starting to climb?
the two voices in my head are having debates
my mind and mouth won't communicate.

The temperature is starting to climb
suddenly there's a dissidence and all I can do is mime.
My mind and mouth won't communicate,
I look up and realize it's too late.

A dissidence and all I can do is mime.
The hands of the clock stuck in place
I look up and realize it's too late.
I wouldn’t be surprised if I stutter during this line.
