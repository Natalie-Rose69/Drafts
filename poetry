Anxiety

I wouldn’t be surprised if I stutter during this line
My heart is racing and I'm losing time
Why are the hands of the clock stuck in place
the two voices in my head are having debates

My heart is racing and I'm losing time
is the temperature starting to climb?
the two voices in my head are having debates
my mind and mouth won't communicate

the temperature starting to climb
Suddenly there's a dissidence and all I can do is mime
my mind and mouth won't communicate
I look up and realize it's too late

There's a dissidence and all I can do is mime
Why are the hands of the clock stuck in place
I look up and realize it's too late
I wouldn’t be surprised if I stutter during this line
