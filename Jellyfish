I'm a pushover,  I'm moved by the tides
get my legs and arms ripped off as I crash onto the shore
I don't feel pain, I can't feel pain.
So when I crash upon the shore without my limbs I lay there
in the sun for seconds, minutes, hours
until someone finds me up
a boy this time, who stares at me
looks right through me at what lies beneath
see my missing tenticles and that I can not sting him
he picks me up and shows me to his friend
I meet him parents and extended family
he's smiling, he's happy, I'm happy?
then he seems to remember I'm a jelly fish
See-through , spineless, missing my limbs
He remembers I don't feel pain
He throughs me back in the water
to search for something knew
and I get swept away with the tide to do it all again.
